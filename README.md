# 🔍 CILens - CI/CD Insights Tool

A Rust CLI tool for collecting and analyzing CI/CD insights from GitLab.

## ✨ Features

- **🧩 Smart Pipeline Clustering** - Groups pipelines by job signature and filters out rare pipeline types (configurable threshold, default 1%)
- **⏱️ Per-Job Time-to-Feedback** - Shows how long each job takes to complete from pipeline start, revealing actual developer wait times
- **🔍 Dependency Tracking** - Identifies which jobs block others, showing the critical path to each job
- **⚠️ Flakiness Detection** - Identifies unreliable jobs that fail intermittently and need retries
- **📊 Success Rate Metrics** - Per-pipeline-type success rates and failure analysis
- **🎯 Optimization Insights** - Jobs sorted by total duration to quickly identify highest-impact optimization targets

### 📖 Key Metrics Explained

- **🧩 Pipeline Type Clustering**: Groups pipelines by job signature (exact match). Pipeline types below the configured threshold (default 1%) are filtered out to reduce noise.
- **📊 Type Metrics** (under `metrics`):
  - **`percentage`**: Percentage of total pipelines that belong to this type
  - **`total_pipelines`**: Total number of pipelines in this type
  - **`successful_pipelines`**: Object with `count` and `links` - clickable GitLab URLs to investigate successful pipeline runs
  - **`failed_pipelines`**: Object with `count` and `links` - clickable GitLab URLs to drill down into failed pipeline runs
  - **`success_rate`**: Percentage of successful pipeline runs
  - **`avg_duration_seconds`**: Average pipeline execution time
  - **`avg_time_to_feedback_seconds`**: Average time until first feedback (from the fastest job)
- **💼 Job Metrics** (under `metrics.jobs`, sorted by `avg_time_to_feedback_seconds` descending):
  - **`avg_duration_seconds`**: How long the job itself takes to run
  - **`avg_time_to_feedback_seconds`**: Time from pipeline start to job completion (when developers get feedback)
  - **`predecessors`**: Jobs that must complete before this one (on the critical path to this job), with their durations
  - **`flakiness_rate`**: Percentage of job executions that were retries (0.0 if job never needed retries)
  - **`flaky_retries`**: Object with `count` and `links` - clickable GitLab URLs to investigate specific flaky job runs
  - **`failed_executions`**: Object with `count` and `links` - clickable GitLab URLs to investigate failed job runs
  - **`failure_rate`**: Percentage of executions that failed and stayed failed (indicates how often the job catches real bugs)
  - **`total_executions`**: Total number of times this job executed across all pipelines, including successful runs, flaky retries, and failures
- **✅ Success Rate**: Percentage of successful pipeline runs for each type

**Finding optimization targets:** Jobs with the highest `avg_time_to_feedback_seconds` have the worst time-to-feedback and are the best candidates for optimization. Check their `predecessors` to see if you can parallelize or speed up dependencies. Jobs with high `flakiness_rate` indicate intermittent reliability issues - click the `flaky_retries.links` to investigate specific flaky runs in GitLab. Jobs with high `failure_rate` are successfully catching bugs - click the `failed_executions.links` to see which runs failed and analyze the logs.
